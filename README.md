# AgricTrack App
AgricTrack project is a Farm Web App that provides farmers with a todo list and live weather reports. It aims to assist farmers in managing their daily tasks and staying updated on weather conditions that may affect their farming activities.

# Pain Problem
Farmers often face challenges in organizing their tasks and keeping track of important activities. Additionally, staying informed about weather conditions is crucial for making informed decisions related to crop cultivation, irrigation, and pest control. Traditional methods of managing tasks and accessing weather information may be time-consuming and inefficient, thus AgricTrack is born.

# Solution
The AgricTrack Web App provides a user-friendly interface for farmers to create and manage their todo list. Farmers can easily add, edit, and mark tasks as complete, ensuring they stay organized and focused on their daily activities. 

The app also integrates a live weather report system, providing real-time weather updates for the farmer's specific location. This helps farmers make timely decisions and take appropriate actions based on the weather forecast.

# Key Features
## Todo List: 
Farmers can create and manage their tasks, set deadlines, and mark tasks as complete.

## Live Weather Reports: 
The app fetches real-time weather data and displays it in an easily understandable format, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed.

## Location-based Weather: 
Weather information is specific to the farmer's location, ensuring accurate and relevant data.

## User Authentication: 
Users can create accounts and securely log in to access their personalized todo list and weather reports.

# Future Possibilities
The Farm Web App has potential for further enhancements and features, including:

## Crop Management: 
Integration with crop databases to provide farmers with information on crop-specific tasks, planting seasons, and best practices.

## Notifications and Reminders: 
Automated reminders and notifications to keep farmers updated on approaching deadlines or significant weather changes.

## Data Analytics: 
Analyzing historical weather data and task completion trends to provide insights and optimize farm management strategies.

## Collaboration and Sharing: 
Enabling farmers to collaborate, share tasks, and exchange information with other farmers or agricultural experts.

We welcome contributions from the community to expand the app's functionality and make it a comprehensive tool for farmers worldwide.
